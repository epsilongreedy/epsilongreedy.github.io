    <description><![CDATA[Summary 1984 is about an attempt to brainwash an entire nation into subservience. &ldquo;The Party&rdquo; controls nearly all aspects of its citizens' lives: when they get up and go to work, what they wear, what forms of entertainment they can engage in, what they are allowed to say and think. Every citizen&rsquo;s home is equipped with a &ldquo;telescreen&rdquo; which is both a surveillance camera and a propaganda outlet. Needless to say, the smallest sign of nonconformity is punished by forced labour or death (or so it seems).]]></description>
